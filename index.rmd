## Pilot study A Deriving turbidity of waterways from UAV-based multispectral camera

### Methodology

**1. Data acquisition**

  + Acquiring multispectral images (Green, Red, Red Edge,NIR) by drone
  + Turbidity and suspended solids water samples from 10 validation points 

**2. Data processing**

  + Creating reflectance maps from the bands in Pix4D Mapper photogrammertry software
  + Georeferencing the reflectance maps to improve projection accuracy
  + Calculate band ratio and band index maps from the reflectance maps
  + Calculate turbidity map using a single band multisensor equation ([Nechad et al., 2009 ](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/252685483_Calibration_and_validation_of_a_generic_multisensor_algorithm_for_mapping_of_turbidity_in_coastal_waters))
  + Extract reflectance data from band ratio, band index and single band turbidity maps

**3. Data analysis**

  + Evaluate and clean remote sensing data
  + Investigate the relationship between reflectance remote sensing data and laboratory results of the turbidity and total suspended solids water samples by using a linear model
  + Validate the correlation between turbidty map (derived from the single band equation) and the laboratory results of the turbidty and total suspended solids
