## Remote sensing instruments used in this study

```{r, out.width = "50%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("drone.png")

```
 
*Parrot Sequoia multispectral camera mounted under a drone (left) and a FLIr One Pro thermal camera attached on a Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone (right)*
 
 
## Pilot study A Deriving turbidity of a waterway from drone-based multispectral camera
 
###Approach


![](flowchart.png){width="100%"} 

*Taken from 10 sample locations 

**Calculated using a single band turbidity algorithm by Nechad et al. [(2009)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266852538_A_single_algorithm_to_retrieve_turbidity_from_remotely-sensed_data_in_all_coastal_and_estuarine_waters)


**Study area Lollebeek (lat: 51.489167,long: 6.055111)**

### Data analysis

**Descriptive statistics**
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
library(kableExtra)
library(readxl)
summary_map <- read_excel("summary_map.xlsx")
kable(summary_map, "html") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```

**Predictive models**
